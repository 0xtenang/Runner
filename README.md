# RUNNER — run to earn (beta)

A simple, Strava-style running app with a run-to-earn layer: own a **RUNNER Genesis** sneaker NFT, run inside its pace zone, and earn the **RUNNER** token.

**Try it:** https://runearn.fun

> Beta: sneaker NFTs are on **Robinhood Chain Testnet** (free test ETH, not real money). RUNNER is an in-app token with no cash value yet.

## Install on your phone

1. Open the link above on your phone.
2. Add it to your home screen:
   - **iPhone (Safari):** Share → *Add to Home Screen*
   - **Android (Chrome):** ⋮ menu → *Install app* / *Add to Home screen*
3. Open RUNNER from the home screen and go through the short setup.

## What to test

1. **Onboarding** — pick a starter sneaker and enter your name.
2. **Record a real outdoor run** — tap Record → Start. Check the GPS line, distance and pace look right (compare with your watch if you have one).
3. **Earning** — with a sneaker NFT equipped, the bar says *Earning*, *Too fast* or *Too slow* for its pace zone. RUNNER appears when you finish.
4. **Import from your watch** — You → Devices → choose files:
   - **Garmin:** Garmin Connect (web) → open a run → ⚙ → *Export Original* (.zip)
   - **COROS / Suunto:** export the run as .fit
   - **Polar:** Polar Flow → *Export session* (.tcx / .gpx)
   - **Apple Watch:** export with HealthFit or RunGap (.fit / .gpx)
5. **Get a sneaker** — sign in, open Earn → *Browse sneakers*, pick one and buy it with test ETH (Common 0.005 · Uncommon 0.015 · Rare 0.04 · Epic 0.1).
6. **Earn tab** — level up, assign attribute points (Efficiency / Resilience) and repair with RUNNER.

## Known limitations

- **iPhone:** Safari pauses GPS when the screen locks — keep the screen on while running (the app asks it to stay awake).
- **Bluetooth heart-rate sensors** work in Chrome on Android / desktop, not on iPhone.
- Data lives on each device — no accounts, friends or leaderboards yet.
- Only runs recorded live with GPS earn RUNNER; imported runs count for stats and streaks.
- You need at least one RUNNER Genesis sneaker NFT to earn.

## Send feedback

Found a bug or have an idea? [Open an issue](https://github.com/0xtenang/Runner/issues/new) — include your phone model, browser and what happened. You can also reach it from **Settings → Send feedback** in the app.

## Run locally

It's a static web app — no build step:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 5190
```

Then open http://localhost:5190. `samples/` contains example FIT / GPX / TCX / ZIP files for testing imports.

## RUNNER Genesis NFT contract

`contracts/RunnerGenesis.sol` — 9,999 sneaker NFTs (ERC-721) on Robinhood Chain. Buyers pick a token id and pay its price; payments go straight to the owner's treasury. Rarity (and price) comes from the token id with the same formula the app uses, so app and chain always agree.

- Build: Solidity 0.8.24, optimizer 200 runs, EVM `paris` — creation-code keccak `0x9d6131b6577e0744614ee3fc30e34c5aedadf43200284436f2b11cdfc93b5bb9`.
- Deploy: the owner opens `/admin.html`, signs in, compiles (the page checks the fingerprint) and deploys from their Privy wallet. Then set `NFT_CONTRACT` in `js/config.js`.
